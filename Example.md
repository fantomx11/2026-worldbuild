This is the table label that labels the table
{: .table-header }
| Character Level | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Mauris vestibulum |
| 6rd | Praesent dui risus (2d8) |
| 12rd | Nulla auctor viverra orci (3d8) |

## Subsection: Does not span

Donec nisl mi, dictum at sapien aliquet, efficitur iaculis odio. Morbi at semper nisl, in ultrices nibh. Nunc venenatis scelerisque erat, iaculis semper dolor fringilla sed.

Text in boxes like these are meant to be read aloud or paraphrased to players as they first arrive at a location or given specific conditions described in the text.

### About sub-subs

Sub-subs, h3s, or sections of sections of chapters perhaps
{: .opening-flavour

Fusce vehicula placerat ullamcorper. Praesent dui risus, interdum at eros sit amet, mattis volutpat nunc.

You can sub-divide sections even further to explain more minor point. Like if you want to explain about different kinds of movement.

#### Burrow

Curabitur rutrum non diam in eleifend.

#### Climb

Nulla gravida dui et ipsum iaculis eleifend.

#### Fly

Aenean volutpat, nisi in pellentesque consectetur, dui mauris tempor sapien, non volutpat quam quam id arcu.

Below is a list of some creatures that can fly:

**Unladen Swallows** can fly. Some have even been known to carry coconuts over long distances.

**Bees** can fly too. They like birds, so sometimes they fly together.

**Penguins** can fly too if they swim really fast first.

Fusce maximus lacus pulvinar augue venenatis, sed ullamcorper odio gravida. Maecenas nec dapibus elit, et faucibus enim. Nulla auctor viverra orci ac tempor. Mauris fringilla rhoncus nibh, quis volutpat velit vehicula et.

<div class="sidenote">
#### Sidenotes

Sometimes we might have asides to include.

This is the kind of place we can put them.

Don't quote me on that though.
