The realm of Sa'ngirr is shaped by consciousness. Since beings from the material realm do not experience this kind of environment, when they enter Sa'ngirr their experience is very different from natives of the realm. Sa'ngirr is constantly trying to manifest the ideas that exist in their minds. With enough discipline and practice, this can be prevented, but doing so causes a constant pressure on the mind. Particularly talented beings are able to control what is manifested.
