The Nitha'yorr, being from a plane of mental constructs, find undisciplined consciousness to be dangerous. Undisciplined consciousness manifests dangerous creatures and alters basic reality in ways that are unpredictable. This is the reason that they hunt consciousness. Their goal is to remove all freedom of thought from all planes, because this freedom of thought affects their realm regardless of whether the thought is in Sa'ngirr or not.

San'girr is something like Plato's realm of forms.
