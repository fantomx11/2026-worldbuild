Kirs entered the small chamber. She had been summoned to Master Orstin's study. The old mage sat hunched over a piece of parchment writing something that she couldn't see. The chamber was lit only by a candle, even though most masters made use of ignis wells.

Kirs stood there for several minutes before Orstin acknowledged her.

"You're here," was all he grumbled, not bothering to take his attention away from his parchment. "Please, have a seat."

Kirs looked around and sat in the chair that was against the wall.

"I've summoned you because you've caught the eye of Ilgader. He says you have potential. Tell me, what do you know of [Sa'ngir](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/01/sa-ngirr.html)?"

Kirs searched her memory. The word sounded familiar, but she recalled nothing specific. "I'm afraid I don't know anything about that."

Orstin looked up and studied her for a moment. Inscrutable thoughts crossed his eyes before he went back to his parchment. "Sa'ngirr is a different realm. Even the fundamental rules that dictate how our world operates do not exist there. Because of this, few mages can safely travel there. Ilgader thinks you have the potential. He asked me to talk to you about it, since I am one of the few who can."

He stopped talking abruptly. Kirs waited for him to continue, but then thought he must be waiting for her to respond. She opened her mouth to speak, and he continued.

"There are two paths that can lead to safe travel in Sa'ngirr. Don't let Miras tell you otherwise. He's too hasty, and does not acknowledge that his [third wa](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/13/the-false-solipsism.html) always results in eventual failure."

Kirs thought about Miras, the Master Mage of the Frenetic Order. It made sense that his haste would lead to failure.

Orstin continued, "If you want, I can teach you my method of protecting myself from Sa'ngirr. There are drawbacks, though. It takes focus and a disciplined mind, and you will not master it in a year. It will take many years before you are ready to enter Sa'ngirr."

Orstin stood up and went to his bookshelf. After scanning it for a few moments, he pulled out a purple tome. "This entire conversation may seem odd to you, since you aren't familiar with Sa'ngirr. These are my own notes on my travels there. You may borrow it, and read it. If you are interested in studying it more, we can begin your training."

Kirs took the book, and looked at it. There was a strange symbol she had never seen on the cover. "You mentioned that there were two ways," she said.

Orstin sat back down at his desk. "Yes, my method requires a [disciplined min](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/14/the-way-of-mu.html). A disciplined mind can safely travel in Sa'ngirr, but minds are fickle and discipline can fail. The [other wa](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/12/the-solipsist-s-trap.html) is more reliable, but it requires believing that everything you perceive is a product of your own mind. Beliefs are more reliable than discipline, but discipline can be relaxed. Beliefs cannot. This means those beliefs affect you here in Hawjio too. You will believe that Hawjio, your friends, your home, everything is just in your imagination. If you want to pursue Sa'ngirr, and choose to use belief rather than discipline, I cannot help you, but I can introduce you to someone who can. Let me know in a fortnight your decision." He motioned for Kirs's dismissal.
