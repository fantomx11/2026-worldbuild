Certain mages, often of the [frenetic orde](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/06/mage-college-of-wargysdinun.html), do not feel it is necessary to adopt the [mental bastio](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/12/the-solipsist-s-trap.html). They try to fake it with an illusion spell. This spell deludes a person into believing solipsism for a time, but it is unstable. The true beliefs of the person will always come through, and if this happens in [Sa'ngir](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/01/sa-ngirr.html), their fears and fleeting thoughts will become reality. Whether through horror or bliss, the traveler will often get lost in Sa'ngirr if this happens.
