Sotha'n is the [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html) that is tasked with preserving the [First Though](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/10/the-first-thought.html). They are constantly examining all planes looking for anyone that is considering the First Thought, and ruthlessly excising that person's mind.

Sotha'n has little care or even reason to be gentle or conservative, and will swiftly reduce the person to a husk if even a hint of the First Thought is there. That is how vital they consider the First Thought.
