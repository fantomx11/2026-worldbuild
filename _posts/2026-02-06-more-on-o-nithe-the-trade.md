A transaction with [O'nith](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/05/o-nithe-the-merchant-of-forgotten-memories.html) usually starts by a person seeking specific lost knowledge. O'nithe, if they have a memory that can convey this knowledge, will propose a trade in concepts.

A memory gained from O'nithe is odd. They will now have the memory of someone else's experience. Depending on the specifics of that experience, it can have drastic effects on the psychology of the person. Furthermore, the concept that was traded away becomes incomprehensible to the person. The effect of these two things can cause the person to become insane, or if the concept is less vital to daily life, it may never even come up in the person's life.
