The [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html) have a different method of creating new concepts. The Ashtep are a group of Nitha'yorr tasked with tending and cultivating new concepts. The process is meticulous as the Ashtep decide whether a concept is blighted and prune it to protect the rest of the crop.

[O'nith](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/05/o-nithe-the-merchant-of-forgotten-memories.html) is opposed to this, they don't think that the Nitha'yorr should be imposing their values on the rest of the planes. Nitha'yorr should be stewards of concepts, not dictators.
