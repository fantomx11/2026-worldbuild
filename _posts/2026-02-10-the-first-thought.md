The first concept is the concept from which ALL other concepts have been synthesized. It is incredibly sacred to the [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html) because corrupting it could corrupt every other concept. Branch corruption has happened before and the Nitha'yorr had to eradicate entire generations of concepts.

This is why they are so protective of the concepts. The closer the concept is to the First Thought, the more aggressively they protect it.
