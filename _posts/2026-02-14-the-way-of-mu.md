One other way to enter [Sa'ngir](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/01/sa-ngirr.html) is to be practiced in the Way of Mu. A Mu practitioner has spent time practicing the eradication of thoughts. This can take years to perfect and requires a highly disciplined mind. However, when practicing Mu, Sa'ngirr has no thoughts to coalesce on as a manifestation.

This method of traveling around Sa'ngirr is less stable than the [Solipsist’s Tra](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/12/the-solipsist-s-trap.html), but does not have the psychological effects, and is much more stable than [False Solipsis](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/13/the-false-solipsism.html).
