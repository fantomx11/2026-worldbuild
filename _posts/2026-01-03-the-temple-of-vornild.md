The Temple of Vornild is a major landmark in the Imperial Riding. It is where the Ecclesiarch of Vornild lives. Nearly as grand as the Imperial Palace, the Temple of Vornild is a major power in Imperial politics. The Vornildian Ecclesium controls several ridings, and often sends Vindicatori Guards into neighboring Ridings, in order to protect their interests. The Vornildians have a preemptive defense policy when it comes to dealing with neighbor ridings. Because the Emperor derives not an insignificant amount of political power from the Ecclesiarch, this defense is often overlooked unless the defense angers some other Noble House.
