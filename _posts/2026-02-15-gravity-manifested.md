A [Forcefu](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/06/mage-college-of-wargysdinun.html) mage named Tosus wanted to study the concept of gravity with the hopes of discovering a way to control the mass of the world around him. He entered [Sa'ngir](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/01/sa-ngirr.html) after casting a spell of [False Solipsis](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/13/the-false-solipsism.html), and proceeded to search for the area where the concept of gravity existed. While there studying it, the spell failed and the gravity in that area immediately increased and crushed Tosus.

A Party of patient mages were sent to find him, and only found unidentifiable crushed remains. This area remains gravitationally volatile, and there is ongoing efforts by the Mage College to restore stability, at least as much as is possible in Sa'ngirr.
