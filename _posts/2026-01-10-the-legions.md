The legions are the imperial military. They have an elite group, named the Imperial Guard, who are tasked specifically with protecting the Emperor, but this relationship has been diminished since Lendan Daress. The Imperial Guard still exists, and still protects the Emperor, but now the Emperor also employs personal body guards as well.

The legions themselves handle the security of important infrastructure, guard the foundations of the city from the deep caverns, maintain outposts in the deep caverns, and maintain order/quell any rebellions.
