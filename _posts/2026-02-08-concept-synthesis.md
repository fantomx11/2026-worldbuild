So [Sa'ngir](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/01/sa-ngirr.html) is the realm where concepts exist. Yet [O'nith](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/05/o-nithe-the-merchant-of-forgotten-memories.html) can trade for novel and new concepts, making them available to all planes in the multiverse. This is a bit of a paradox since how can the concept exist in a seeker's head if it doesn't exist in Sa'ngirr. This is the function of consciousness. It takes existing pure concepts and mixes them together to synthesize new concepts. This mixing of concepts is what the [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/bestiary/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html) see as a corruption, and O'nithe values.
