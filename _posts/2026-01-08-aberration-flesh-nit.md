title: Aberration- Flesh Nit
---

A Flesh-nit is not a single creature, but a mass of low-intelligence, corrupted biomass that clings to surfaces in the Deep. It looks like a shifting, pallid mound of skin, tumorous growths, and exposed internal tissues. Its surface is constantly "breathing," covered in thousands of small, circular pores and shallow pits that weep oily, chemical-smelling fluids.

They spread through physical contact and airborne spores emitted by its pores. Exposure causes rapid, agonizing tissue breakdown and spontaneous, minor mutations in the victim (extra joints, misplaced eyes, hardened bone spurs). Its presence weakens nearby stone and mortar, causing localized collapses. Anyone escaping an encounter with a Flesh-nit has to face the agonizing realization that they might be infected.
