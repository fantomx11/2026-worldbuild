title: The Imperial Archives
---

The Empire has kept records since the founding of Hawjio. All of the records are contained in the Imperial Archives. They are stored magically on crystals that can be accessed using a cogniscrim. A cogniscrim is a handheld device that accepts a cognishard. When connected, it displays an illusion of text floating in the air above the cogniscrim. The user can then browse through the information on the cognishard. Cognishards do not just store text. They can also store events as if they had been scryed.
