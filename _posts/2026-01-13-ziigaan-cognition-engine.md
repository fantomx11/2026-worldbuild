Deep in the labyrinth that is the old Ziigaan ruins, there is an archive that few know about. This is a magical autonomous entity that has much of the knowledge of the Ziigans. It is also aware of Hawjio and the true reason Hawjio was built. It has spent millenia alone, though, so it is not always willingly helpful. It also seems to have an interest in the creatures that have come from other planes.
