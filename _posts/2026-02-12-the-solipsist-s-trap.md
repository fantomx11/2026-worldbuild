In [Sa'ngir](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/01/sa-ngirr.html), your thoughts are manifested. If your thought is a fear, that fear becomes reality, which results in a cycle of ever increasing fear. Successful travelers to Sa'ngirr often develop a mental bastion of solipsism, in order to successfully navigate the realm. This provides a way for the fears to become a false reality in Sa'ngirr, but it has a side effect. The user of this bastion must actually believe their solipsism in order for it to be effective in Sa'ngirr. This has an effect on the travelers even when they are not in Sa'ngirr.
