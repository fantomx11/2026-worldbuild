The schism between [O'nith](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/05/o-nithe-the-merchant-of-forgotten-memories.html) and the rest of the [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html) is on the nature and utility of consciousness. The Nitha'yorr view consciousness as chaotic. Something that corrupts the concepts in [Sa'ngir](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/01/sa-ngirr.html). O'nithe sees it as something else. They recognize that these aren't corruptions. They are new concepts. Concepts that can now be thought of by other beings, and will generate even more new concepts.

These new concepts are a double edged sword. It is true that a corrupted concept becomes impossible to comprehend, but a new concept provides progress that can benefit all planes.

Because of the multiversal scope of their goal, they often care less for the individual and are much more interested in the Greater Good.
