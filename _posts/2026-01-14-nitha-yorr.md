title: Nitha'yorr
---

Nitha'yorrs resemble tall slender humans with long limbs. Their skulls are smooth with no eyes, ears or noses, where their mouth should be are four retractable, needle-thin mandibles.

They hunt consciousness. They don't care about the body, but rather consume the thoughts, memories, and knowledge of their victims. They capture prey, and hold them in a paralytic state slowly siphoning the mind until their victim is left catatonic.

They also seem to exert some amount of psychic control over others.
