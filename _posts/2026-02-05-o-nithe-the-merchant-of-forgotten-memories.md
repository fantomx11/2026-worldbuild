O'nithe is a [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html) that has rejected the Nitha'yorr society. This one offers to give memories to other beings in return for interesting concepts. The other being loses that concept and gains the memory. It is unpredictable what concept O'nithe may find interesting, and no one really knows what they do with the concepts they are collecting, but it is one way to gain knowledge that is otherwise unavailable. Since Nitha'yorr are functionally immortal, O'nithe has been around a very long time and collected many many memories. Some of these are collected as a being is dying, but others are collected in the same way all Nitha'yorr collect memories, and they result in the being who created the memory becoming an empty husk.
