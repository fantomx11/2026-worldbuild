title: Planar Nexus
---

Hawjio was not actually built on the world of its founders. The ancient civilization that founded Hawjio built it as an outpost in a planar war with the Eldritch plane. Later they realized they could seal off the entire Eldritch plane if they did so with an enormous magic seal, but it would require the seal to be set at a planar nexus and would result in that nexus being cut off from all planes. Furthermore, it would require maintenance. This meant that a group of volunteers had to choose to live in the city and never return.

Although the citizens of Hawjio have forgotten it, the Eldritch plane still remembers the war and the purpose of Hawjio.
