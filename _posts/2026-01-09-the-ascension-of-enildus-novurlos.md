title: The Ascension of Enildus Novurlos
---

Enildus Novurlos was one of the emperors during the succession crisis after Lendan Daress died. Unlike the other emperors, Enildus was not a member of a major house. He wasn't even a member of the nobility at all. He had come from the soldier caste, and managed to become a lieutenant in the Imperial Guard, a rank that is normally reserved for the nobility. Mafta Vethrowis, the immediately preceding emperor, angered the Guard, and they decided to assassinate him. They elected Enildus to take his place as Emperor. This brought a brief respite to the succession crisis, but ultimately did not end it. As Enildus was poisoned just over a year later, and the next emperor had the Imperial Guard executed to prevent any reprisals.
