When a [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html) creates a husk, [the Colleg](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/06/mage-college-of-wargysdinun.html) will often take them for study. Sometimes a husked person will suddenly regain consciousness, and the college is interested in this phenomenon. What they have discovered is that the person that regains consciousness is definitely not the same as the person that lost it. The person cannot speak any known language, but instead appear to be speaking another language. In a few cases the college has managed to translate some of the language, and they have gathered from this that the person has memories, but not of Hawjio. However, others, based on an analysis of the phonemes, appear to be speaking different languages. At least seven have been categorized with a few others being unknown if they are separate languages or one of the seven. These people are called the Hulled. 

What is more concerning is that some of the Hulled do not appear to understand causality or distinguish things in reality. Of another concern, there is a trend among members of language three, named Nonsu after the first word identified in this language, to escape and disappear. The college reports to the empire that this warrants more investigation.
