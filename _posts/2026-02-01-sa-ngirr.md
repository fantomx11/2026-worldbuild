Sa'ngirr is the name of the realm that the citizens of Hawjio call the Eldritch Plane. It is a world of mental constructs. The Nitha'yorr are the architects of the realm, building their spires out of crystalized memories.

While the flesh-nits are an invasive species on Hawjio, in Sa'ngirr, they are part of the environment. Fields of flesh-nit mass form sweeping planes that can seem quite beautiful once the initial uncanniness of the environment gives way to normalcy.
