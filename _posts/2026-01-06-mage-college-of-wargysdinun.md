The Mage College of Wargysdinun is the most prestigious school of magic in the city. It is located in the Imperial Riding.

The college itself stands tall. Only surpassed by the Emperor's palace itself. It not only stands as a place of learning and practicing magic, but it also is the place where the Mage Council meets to discuss the affairs of the Empire as it involves the various mage orders.

There are 5 orders in the college. No order has access to specific styles of magic, instead orders are organized by the mentality a mage has towards magic and its use.

[need to come up with better names for these orders] Precise, Forceful, Frenetic, Patient, and Deviant

## Precise Order

Precise magic is slower to use than the others, but it has a minimized chance of unintended side effects. Mages of the precise school spend much time studying and refining each spell, making sure they know what each variation does exactly, so that they can use the correct variation at any given time. They treat magic as a precise mathematical system.

## Forceful Order

Forceful magic is all about bending reality to the will of the mage. It is battle of the will of reality vs. the will of the mage. Mages of this order prefer magic that has bold, powerful effects over subtle ones. They mostly focus on the biggest effect any magic has, and ignore the subtle differences.

## Frenetic Order

Frenetic magic is about speed. The faster the magic can be used the better. Frenetic mages prefer quantity over quality.

## Patient Order

Patient magic is often the most powerful. A patient mage may spend months building the necessary framework for a ritual, but this ritual may alter the very fabric of reality.

## Deviant Order

This is less of an order, and more of a catch-all for minor orders and hedge mages that do not fit into the others.
