The elves have the natural psychic ability to cloud minds. They use this to become spies and assassins. Their ability allows them to have perfect disguises. People who encounter an elf find that the elf looks like a very close friend. No one really knows what the elves look like, and many think they don't actually exist. The elves prefer it this way. The anonymity that is afforded by people not even knowing if they exist is extremely useful to a people who gain their power by subterfuge.

The elves live by a strict code that is meant to preserve their core abilities.

* The veil must not be lifted. An Elf shall never take a position of overt authority that would subject the race to scrutiny or retaliation.

* Never break the guise of another of the Kind. An Elf shall never willingly reveal their true face or identity to another Elf while in disguise.

* No act shall bear the Elven signature. All acts of assassination, espionage, or manipulation must be attributable to human factions, internal conflict, or random misfortune.

They keep this code because they already rule from the shadows, as much as the concerns of Elves are involved, anyway. The cost to maintain a psychic disguise indefinitely can be strenuous, and possibly lead to a loss of the Elf's sanity. Also, the Elves are few in number. They do not have many children as the other races, and are, therefore susceptible to complete loss, if discovered.
