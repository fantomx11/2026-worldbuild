Ages ago, the (*&^$_)(*# (I apologize for this, I am unable to conceive of the concept anymore, as I will explain) concept was corrupted. This was a 4th order concept which meant that an entire branch of concepts that depended on it were also corrupted, and the corruption was threatening to spread to other 4th order concepts. The Nitha'yorr, destroyed the concept and all of its related concepts in order to preserve the integrity of those other branches.

I cannot describe what this concept was, and I cannot even describe how it was corrupted. This is simply something that O'nithe has told me.

Apparently there was an entire realm that was deeply integrated with that concept. When the Nitha'yorr destroyed it, that realm lost all coherence. It is now a place of madness that mortal minds cannot comprehend.
