title: The Dwarves
---

Dwarves are known for their metal works and smithing. They are also the best at creating mechanical devices. The most incredible of all Dwarven inventions are automatic servants. 

Initially created to be sold to nobles as a novelty, they have found much broader use in many areas.

Dwarven automatic servants also help the imperial legion in the most dangerous areas. Often in the warrens, when they are needed, and in the deep.

The Ligernos syndicate has also gotten their hands on some automatic servants, and uses them as enforcers.
