In the untold centuries since the founding of Hawjio, the residual planar effects below have caused seismic instability. The shifting of the foundations has weakened the seal, allowing the planar effects to increase.

There also is a kind of creeping growth that is sometimes found on the foundations of the city. Structures with this creeping growth are often found to be weaker. The creeping growth itself seems to be unintelligent, but there is a pattern to its infection. It seems to concentrate on the most critical parts of the seal.

However, since knowledge of the seal is lost, this is not recognized for the threat it is. It is mitigated as a danger to the structure of the city and nothing more.
