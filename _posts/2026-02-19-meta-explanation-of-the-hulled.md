The Hulled are being possessed by spirits from other planes. Since [Hawji](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/01/the-city-of-hawjio.html) is in a [nexu](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/22/planar-nexus.html), there are spirits from many planes drifting around.

The ones that do not understand causality have come from the plane that was [eradicate](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/17/branch-corruption-and-the-eradication.html) by the [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html).

The Nonsu that are escaping come from a malevolent plane and are trying to destroy Hawjio.
