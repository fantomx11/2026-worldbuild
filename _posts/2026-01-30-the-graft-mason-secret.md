The Graft Masons' Guild, being the ones who reclaim the ruins, sometimes find artifacts from the previous cycle. Most people believe these artifacts come from the Ziigaan civilization, and they are usually cataloged and sent to the Wargysdinun, but some of the Guild Masters are aware that a few of these artifacts are a bit too similar to Hawjio's culture. These artifacts are kept in the hands of the guild. The Masters that are aware of this often communicate among each other, trying to unravel the connection between Ziigaan and Hawjio.
