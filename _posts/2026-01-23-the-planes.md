Since Hawjio sits at a planar nexus, there are actually many different planes that are leaking through as the seal weakens. However, only the Eldritch plane is actively trying to break through, and attempting to weaken the seal. Every once in a while, creatures from the other planes happen to come through though. Rarely, a citizen of Hawjio wanders through to another plane as well.
