title: The Time Loop
---

An integral part of the seal is the time loop. This loop lasts ten thousand years, and the people in Hawjio are not aware of it. However, the city is constantly sinking into the depths, and disappearing. So the city keeps building upward. As they build upward, more ancient ruins appear above them. These ruins, the ruins of the Ziigian civilization, are actually the ruins that have sunk into the depths.

The reason for this time loop is that the seal weakens as it gets older. So the founders realized that they needed to force a continual renewing of the seal if the Eldritch plane were going to be kept out. So the city was designed in such a way that it would always have to keep building.

This is why the depths are uninhabitable, and why the recognition that the ruins are their own goes unrecognized. By the time that the city is three thousand years away from the bottom of the depths, the seal has weakened to the point that it is unsafe to live there. Two thousand years away, and it is unsafe to explore. Thus, the ruins that appear above haven't been seen by anyone in Two thousand years, and have been corrupted by the influence of the Eldritch plane for Three thousand years.
