title: Ziigaan
---

The Ziigaan civilization is the ancient civilization the ruins of which are built on top of. The Ziigaan were very focused on planar magic, and the effects are still felt today. This is the source of the creatures that exist in the deep caverns. The reason Hawjio was built is to maintain the barrier between the world and the other planes. Although this knowledge has been forgotten by all who live, it is available in the vast Imperial Archives. The structure and layout of Hawjio is actually a massive magic seal that was developed by a small group of Patient Mages when it was founded.

The city itself was initially laid out as the seal. Although this has been lost to time, and now only the lowest levels incorporate this layout. People don't notice it because those levels are dangerous to move around due to crime.
