House Vasofith has ruled the empire for over 100 years. Erthed Vasofith, the first in the Vasofith dynasty, ascended to the Etched Throne after a long political struggle involving nearly a decade-long succession crisis. The previous, uncontested Emperor was Lendan Daress of House Daress, and he died without an heir. In the 9 years after his death, there were 15 Emperors. Each of them was assassinated by their successor. The Current Emperor is Doshvan Vasofith and he first sat on the Etched Throne 17 years ago.
