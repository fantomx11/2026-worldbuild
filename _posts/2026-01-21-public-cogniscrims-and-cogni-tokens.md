Cogniscrims are installed at regular locations throughout the city. Anyone with a cogni-token, which is a special type of cognishard that is attuned to a specific individual. A cogni-token can be used to identify the person, and also access their account at the Imperial Bank.

Forged cogni-tokens are difficult to come by, but can be obtained from the Ligneros Syndicate. Being caught with a forged cogni-token can result in imprisonment.

The existence of cogni-tokens has complicated the activities of the elves since they need a cogni-token that is attuned to them, but displays the identity of their disguise. Because of this, they rarely impersonate public figures.
