The concepts that [O'nith](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/05/o-nithe-the-merchant-of-forgotten-memories.html) gathers are not immediately usable in [Sa'ngir](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/01/sa-ngirr.html). They need to be refined, and sometimes combined with other concepts before they can be released to Sa'ngirr. He uses a special kiln and forge he has built for this.

The kiln and forge are hidden from the other [Nitha'yor](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/01/14/nitha-yorr.html) and also from travelers to Sa'ngirr. The use of these are incredibly powerful and could be used for ill.

This release is actually kind of interesting. Once a O'nithe releases a concept, in a quirk of irony, it becomes accessible to the trader, again, but it is no longer possessed solely by the trader.
