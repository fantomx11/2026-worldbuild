title: The Ligernos Syndicate
---

In the lower levels of the city, the borders between the ridings blur. Instead, criminal gangs rule. They facilitate the movement of goods through illicit means, and travel between ridings that are usually not allowed by the official authorities. There are many gangs, and some of them are loosely aligned. This loose alliance is often called the Ligernos Syndicate. The Empire often turns a blind eye because the criminal activities of the Ligernos Syndicate are not disruptive to the general order, and the Ligernos polices itself to make sure that the activities do not reach a level that brings the scrutiny of the Empire.
