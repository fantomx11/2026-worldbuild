title: Noble Houses-High Council of Nobles
---

[Need a cool name for this like Landsraad]

While the Emperor maintains nominal control over the Empire, in many ways the title is a First Among Equals position in the High Council of Noble Houses. The Emperor has a lot of discretion when it comes to directing Imperial resources, but the Council of Nobles could overthrow the Emperor if they allied. The Emperor spends a significant amount of time and effort making sure that the various Houses are directing their influence against the other houses rather than at the Etched Throne.
