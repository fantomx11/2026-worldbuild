One of the effects of the time loop is that ruins are continually descending from the sky. One of the functions of the Empire is to assess and rehabilitate ruined structures for use. While they do not remember their purpose, the inhabitants do realize that the eldritch plane continually rises. So they keep pushing forward, renovating the ruins as they can.

Theoretically, if a person could go through the Eldritch controlled area, they would end up back where they started. It is a kind of mobius loop, except it exists in time and not space.
