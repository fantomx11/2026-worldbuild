The Order of Denishvi is not a part of the college, although they would be considered a deviant order. They focus on ancient and forbidden knowledge. They spend much of their time in the deep caverns under the city searching for the ruins of the civilization that the city was built on top of. They also research the creatures that live in these caverns. They often do this in secret because even the college thinks that these creatures are too dangerous. This is why the Denishvi often operate outside of the college.
