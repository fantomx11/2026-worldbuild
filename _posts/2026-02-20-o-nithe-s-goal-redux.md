While [O'nith](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/05/o-nithe-the-merchant-of-forgotten-memories.html) overall motivation is the [generation of new concept](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/07/more-on-o-nithe-the-motivation.html), they are also trying to resynthesize a specific concept. There was a concept that was [eradicate](https://fantomx11.github.io/2026-worldbuild/2026/02/17/branch-corruption-and-the-eradication.html) that O'nithe lost. They know it was a treasured concept because they can remember it being very important to them, but they cannot recall the concept itself. They are hoping that, by synthesizing new concepts, eventually that concept will be recreated.
