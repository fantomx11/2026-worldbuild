Every 10 years, the Imperial riding ascends. This is accompanied by rituals and celebrations (an attempt at reframing this move as a renewal rather than a retreat). The current Imperial riding is stripped of valuables, and everyone moves to the new riding.

Once the Imperial riding is emptied, it is often a mad grab by various lower level inhabitants to claim the best housing, and snatch up anything of use that was left behind. The Nobility views this as part of the cycle and it is a tradition to leave some things of value for those who are moving in.

The ascension cycle has been adopted by many other ridings, and is no something of a city wide celebration
