The Graft Mason Guild is responsible for assessing, and integrating the ruins above the city. The Mage Guild has determined that the Eldritch plane encroaches on about the 5 lowest levels each year. Because of this, the Graft Masons are responsible for making sure 5 levels above are secured and prepared for habitation each year. As they secure a level, the mage guild assesses where vital government locations will be moved to. They have instituted a system where the imperial ridings only have to move once every 10 years.

The Graft Masons are responsible, not only for securing the ruins, but also for building the vital buildings for governing the ridings.

The Dwarves have crafted many automatic servants to assist with the renovations.
