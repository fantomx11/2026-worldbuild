A concept must exist in San'girr in order to exist in the mind of any being on any plane. This is why the Nitha'yorr engage in such extreme measures to protect the purity of the concepts. If a concept in San'girr is destroyed, or if it is corrupted, the concept changes for every being in all planes. In the most extreme cases, it is not even comprehensible any more.

The Nitha'yorr are the embodiment of the San'girr's proactive defense system against these things happening.
