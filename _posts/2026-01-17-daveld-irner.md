Daveld Irner was a case study performed by the Wargysdinun. He was in the legion assigned to a deep outpost. When his unit was supposed to be rotated out, the next unit found the outpost abandoned except for Daveld. Daveld was found living, but unresponsive.

They carried him back to the city, and when it was reported, the college took an interest. Each order tried to divine the source of his catatonic state, but none of them could learn anything.

One night, a member of the Order of Denishvi came and addressed the council. They had records of others in the deep experiencing the same fate, but were not sure what the cause was. Whatever it was, it seemed they were getting more frequent.
